Cat allows us to read and write to files. 

If we want to see what a files contains we do the following command: 
cat filename

If we want to create a file we do the following: 

cat >filename
Then you get put into the console to type out what your file will contain. In order to escape you hit Ctrl + d 

We can use cat to copy over files: 
cat filetobecopied > newfile
